        <h2>Commander</h2>
        <p>
            I got into the trading card game Magic the Gathering back in high school through the mobile
            app, MtG Arena, and eventually learned about the Commander format in College. I've grown
            to enjoy deckbuilding for this game since there are so many possibilities with the amount of
            cards and with the company, Wizards of the Coast, releasing new sets pretty frequently. I currently 
            run a Green White Lifegain deck. You can click the link underneath my current commander to see the decklist as well
            as some other decks I plan to build or currently have started.
        </p>

        <h2>Basketball</h2>
        <p>
            I've grown up playing basketball since I was a kid, I was on my high school's varisty team since Sophmore
            year, and have loved the game ever since, still play it, still watch it. I haven't really played in a while with school and work keeping me 
            busy, but it's always a good thing to give myself a break and enjoy some time outside or inside improving my game.

    <section class="snowboard">
        <h2>Snowboarding</h2>
        <p>
            When I am back home in Colorado, and mostly when lift ticket prices are actually a reasonable price,
            I go up to the Rockies and go snowboarding. It has been a while since I've gone but it was always something
            my family and I did during the winter months.
