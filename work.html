                        Eventually, I got a job on campus working with the University's Astronomy
                        Department working on one of their internal tools known as ELSA (Educational
                        Labelling System @Atmospheres) doing web development with Python, the Django
                        framework, and Bootstrap. I think I'm coming up to almost 2 years on the job
                        and it has been such a great learning opportunity and experience that I attribute
                        to my future career and endeavors.

                        Back home, I worked at King Soopers (Kroger), under this title on a seasonal basis, which
                        was during the Summer and Winter breaks my first two years of college. I was mainly tasked
                        to shop in-store for the online customers and deliver it to their cars, but after a bit it was
                        that plus training new staff plus filling in in other departments plus customer service, etc.

                    Between the time from King Soopers to my current job, I worked some "odd" jobs, for lack of better phrasing,
                    ranging anywhere from DoorDash delivery driver, to working at an Amazon Warehouse during the graveyard shift to 
                    camp counselor for my high school basketball team's kid's summer camp during high school.
